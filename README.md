# mit-decision-check

This is a python script that logs into your MIT portal to automatically check your decision.

-It checks your decisions every few seconds.

-Downloads the html and checks whether you have been accepted or not.

-Prints your decision to the default printer. Simulatneously it speaks out your decision in a cool robotic voice. (https://clyp.it/j4a413he)

-Is awesome. Will run as a background process.


-----------------

Note: It is currently only supported for Linux. Please request for other OS. Tested on Ubuntu 15.04.

Requirements: Python 2.7, python-twill, and html2text

Pending: use Beautiful Soup for parsing html; develop a server script that checks if decisions are posted (to prevent individual checks and reduce traffic on portal)

Future plans: automaticaly capture video from webcam and post to social networks.

-----------------

Have fun and all the best!
